FADE IN:

ON COMPUTER SCREEN

so close it has no boundaries.

A blinking cursor pulses in the electronic darkness like a
heart coursing with phosphorous light, burning beneath the
derma of black-neon glass.

A PHONE begins to RING, we hear it as though we were
making the call.  The cursor continues to throb,
relentlessly patient, until --

                         MAN (V.O.)
          Yeah?

Data now slashes across the screen, information flashing
faster than we can read:  "Call trans opt:  received.

                         TRINITY (V.O.)
          I know but I felt like taking a
          shift.

The area code is identified.  The first three numbers
suddenly fixed, leaving only seven flowing columns.

                         CYPHER (V.O.)
          You like him, don't you?  You like
          watching him?

We begin MOVING TOWARD the screen, CLOSING IN as each
digit is matched, one by one, snapping into place like the
